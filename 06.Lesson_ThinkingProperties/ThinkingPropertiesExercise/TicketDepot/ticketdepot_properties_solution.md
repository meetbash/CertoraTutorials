## Prioritizing

</br>

### High Priority

- property 5 is high priority since not changing the address to the buyers address will result in the buyer paying for nothing
- property 6 is high priority since offers being bought multiple times will result in someone not getting the ticket

### Medium Priority

- property 2, 3 and 4 are medium priority since having the wrong number of tickets can lead to more tickets being sold than initially expected

### Low Priority

- property 1 is low priority since having the wrong number of events will lead to a statistical error
